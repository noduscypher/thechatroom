## 📘 Project Overview

This is a Python-based Nomadnet page script that creates a ready-to-run IRC-style chatroom.  
Just copy all files from this GitHub release into your `./nomadnetwork/storage/pages/` folder,  
make `nomadnet.mu` and `meshchat.mu`executable with `chmod +x`, and launch your Nomadnet node.

Detailed installation info below.

- 🌍 Decentralized mesh-based communication based on NomadNetwork
- 🧑‍💻 No registration required—just choose a nickname and start chatting
- 🎨 Nicknames are randomly colorized and persist across sessions (user settings personalization is coming soon!)
- 🔒 Nickname to LXMF address binding, using the Fingerprint in Meshchat v2+ to save and recover the nickname across sessions
  (THANKS TO: **THOMAS**)
- 🛠️ Built with Python and Micron components, JSON and SQL DBs for chat, topic and nickname persistency
- 🌐 Official chat script is Hosted on a VPS for stable uptime

# 🆘 Help Page

Welcome to the Help section! This guide outlines all the modules required to run this project, 

along with setup instructions to get you started smoothly.

## 🧰 Requirements

This project uses a combination of Python’s built-in modules and third-party libraries.

### ✅ Built-in Modules (No installation required)

These come bundled with Python and require no additional setup:

| Module              | Purpose                                                                 |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `os`                | Interacts with the operating system (e.g., file paths, environment vars)|
| `sys`               | Accesses system-specific parameters and functions                       |
| `json`              | Parses and manipulates JSON data                                        |
| `time`              | Handles time-based operations (e.g., delays, timestamps)                |
| `random`            | Generates random values and selections                                  |
| `re`                | Performs pattern matching with regular expressions                      |
| `shutil`            | Performs high-level file operations (e.g., copying, moving files)       |
| `collections`       | Provides specialized data structures like `Counter`                     |
| `datetime`          | Manages date and time objects                                           |

### 🌐 Third-Party Libraries (Install via pip)

These must be installed manually:

| Package     | Purpose                                                                 |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `pytz`      | Timezone definitions and conversions                                    |
| `requests`  | Simplified HTTP requests and API calls (needed for /meteo command only) |
| `geopy`     | Geolocation services (e.g., address lookup via Nominatim, as above)     |
| `sqlite3`   | Manages local SQLite database storage for Nickname to LXMF binding      |

To install them, run:

```bash
pip install pytz requests geopy sqlite3
```

and of course, you need to install and configure NomadNet to host the page:

```bash
pip install nomadnet
```

Tested and 100% working also with rns_server_pages by SebastianObi:

## ⚙️ Technical Notes

Here are some important details about how **THE CHATROOM** works and what to expect:

- 🔄 The chatroom does **not auto-refresh** due to Micron limitations  
  → Use the **Reload buttons** that you find in the bottom menubar to view new messages  
- 🧠 Nicknames can be stored using MeshChat’s **Fingerprint binding**
  - Usage: press fingerprint button, set a nickname and reload the page. Nick is saved. 
  → This allows nickname persistence across sessions (thanks to Thomas!)
  - To recover the nickname on lost session cache, press fingerprint again and it will reappear automatically
- 📜 The main chat view shows the **last 30 messages**  to fit MeshChat browser windows, you cn adjust the limit in the script
  → Full logs are available via the **View Logs** button on the bottom menù
- 🧪 The `/meteo` command uses external APIs  
  → Requires `requests` and `geopy` to be installed  
- 🧱 Built with Python and Micron components  
  → Compatible with MeshChat v2.1+ and pure NomadNet client!  
- 🧪 More Features will come soon! Stay Tuned!

## Other Features:

### AntiSpam

The ChatRoom! includes already a good list of antispam filters, based on single words or combined phrases. Add your own or remove the unwanted blocked words to make it less strict in spam_patterns lines section of the script. 

## Fixed UI Windows
The UI is fixed in place with DISPLAY_LIMIT var, limited to ~28 messages to fit the MeshChat 2.0+ Browser window.
Same for the Nomadnet page with simpler approach to limit lines to ~36 
Note: Long user messages are split into multiple lines and it can vary the size of the final rendered UI. 

## NickName Color System
Automatically color the user nickname for better readability, keeps it persistant for any message or command, same nick, same color, you can edit the default colors in the script.

## Nickname & LXMF fingerprint binding (Thanks to Thomas!)
Pressing the Fingerprint button on meshchat v2.1+ , you send your lxmf to the chat and the script will automatically bind the nickname and the lxmf address like a sort of autologin. on rejoining the chat, nickname will be automatically recovered. if the meshchat os variables are missing (in case of reboot for example), just press fingerprint again and based on your lxmf, your nickname will reappear again automatically. Nickname and corresponding LXMF address is saved in a sql db to be recovered.

## Long messages split function
On longer messages, they will automatically be split in multiple lines to keep persistant ui layout and format.

## Statistics and users commands
Show chat statistics, top chatters, total sent message per user, total users in chat (commands: /stats or /users)


---

## Next Work In Progress Features:

### Personalized User Settings
(eg. set your nickname color preferences, possibility to click nickname to share your lxmf address for private chat, remove your nick and lxmf binding, chat theme selection, ecc.)

### Administration Commands
(eg. Add or Remove multiple Administrators)
